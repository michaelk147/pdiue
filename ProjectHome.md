This project was started during my master's thesis. It is a full detection system including learning and detection. It is based on Dalal's work on person detection. My system uses linear SVMs (LIBLINEAR) in combination with some features. For example the famous  Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is included. But Feature combination is also possible. Color Self-Similary by Walk et al. is also implemented and actually improved performance wise.
